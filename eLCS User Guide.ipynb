    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a complete user guide to the eLCS scikit-learn package as well as auxilliary helper objects. eLCS is a supervised learning variant of the Learning Classifier System. In general, Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) are a classification of Rule Based Machine Learning Algorithms that have been shown to perform well on problems involving high amounts of heterogeneity and epistasis. Well designed LCSs are also highly human interpretable. LCS variants have been shown to adeptly handle supervised and reinforced, classification and regression, online and offline learning problems, as well as missing or unbalanced data. These characteristics of versatility and interpretability give LCSs a wide range of potential applications, notably those in biomedicine. This package is still under active development and we encourage you to check back on this repository for updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "eLCS, or Educational Learning Classifier System, implements the core components of a Michigan-Style Learning Classifier System (where the system's genetic algorithm operates on a rule level, evolving a population of rules with each their own parameters) in an easy to understand way, while still being highly functional in solving ML problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Learning Classifier Systems are commonly applied to genetic analyses, where epistatis (i.e. feature interactions) is common, the eLCS algorithm implemented in this package can be applied to almost any supervised classification data set and supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Feature sets that are discrete/categorical, continuous-valued or a mix of both</li>\n",
    "    <li>Data with missing values</li>\n",
    "    <li>Binary Classification Problems (Binary Endpoints)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Multi-class Classification Problems (Multi-class Endpoints)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that the eLCS package does not currently support regression problems (continuous endpoints). Regression functionality is built into the package. However, we have decided to disable it for this version, since eLCS performs best on purely classification problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are 4 requirements for the dataset:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Data Attributes for all data instances are represented by an <b>nxm</b> numpy.ndarray, where <b>n</b> = # of instances and <b>m</b> = # of attributes for each instance</li>\n",

    "    <li>Both the <b>nxm</b> attribute array and the length <b>n</b> phenotype array are fully numeric. This means that every element in each array must be convertable to a float. String, boolean types are not permitted (of course, boolean datasets can be represented by binary 0s and 1s). It is important to mention that missing data in the attribute dataset is acceptable, if represented as a NaN type within the array. Missing data in the phenotype array is not acceptable.</li>\n",
    "    <li>As mentioned aboved, the problem must be a classification problem. This version does not support regression problems.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "The package includes automated parameter checking that will raise an Exception at the start of training if the dataset does not meet the above requirements.\n"

    "A nice feature about all of the rule population methods is that even if **evalWhileFit** == False during training, you can still call **getAccuracy(finalIterationNumber)**, **getFinalAccuracy()**, and **exportFinalRulePopulationToCSV(headerNames, classLabel)** successfully without raising an Exception. Even if the evaluation wasn't done during training, these methods will run the evaluation on the final rule population if necessary during the call, and return/export your desired data anyway."
