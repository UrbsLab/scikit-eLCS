    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a complete user guide to the core sklearn-compatible scikit-eLCS package as well as auxilliary helper objects included in the package. eLCS is a supervised learning variant of the Learning Classifier System. In general, Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) are a classification of Rule Based Machine Learning Algorithms that have been shown to perform well on problems involving high amounts of heterogeneity and epistasis. Well designed LCSs are also highly human interpretable. LCS variants have been shown to adeptly handle supervised and reinforced, classification and regression, online and offline learning problems, as well as missing or unbalanced data. These characteristics of versatility and interpretability give LCSs a wide range of potential applications, notably those in biomedicine. This package is still under active development and we encourage you to check back on this repository for updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "eLCS, or Educational Learning Classifier System, implements the core components of a Michigan-Style Learning Classifier System (where the system's genetic algorithm operates on a rule level, evolving a population of rules with each their own parameters) in an easy to understand way, while still being highly functional in solving ML problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Learning Classifier Systems are commonly applied to genetic analyses, where epistatis (i.e. feature interactions) is common, the eLCS algorithm implemented in this package can be applied to almost any supervised classification data set and supports:\n",

    "    <li>Multi-class Classification Problems (Multi-class Endpoints)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that the eLCS package does not currently support regression problems (continuous endpoints). Regression functionality is built into the package. However, we have decided to disable it for this version, since eLCS performs best on purely classification problems.\n",

    "### Dataset Format Requirement for scikit-eLCS\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 requirements for the dataset:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Data Attributes for all data instances are represented by an <b>nxm</b> numpy.ndarray, where <b>n</b> = # of instances and <b>m</b> = # of attributes for each instance</li>\n",
    "    <li>Data Phenotypes for all data instances are represented by a 1 dimensional numpy.ndarray of length <b>n</b></li>\n",
    "    <li>Both the <b>nxm</b> attribute array and the length <b>n</b> phenotype array are fully numeric. This means that every element in each array must be convertable to a float. String, boolean types are not permitted (of course, boolean datasets can be represented by binary 0s and 1s). It is important to mention that missing data in the attribute dataset is acceptable, if represented as a NaN type within the array. Missing data in the phenotype array is not acceptable.</li>\n",
    "    <li>As mentioned aboved, the problem must be a classification problem. This version does not support regression problems.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The package includes automated parameter checking that will raise an Exception at the start of training if the dataset does not meet the above requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we present 2 methods to load data of the correct format for the eLCS model. The first is the commonly used pandas. The second is a custom, standalone method included with this package named StringEnumerator, that will make your life much easier in terms of ensuring data formatting requirements are met for the eLCS model."

    "### track_accuracy_while_fit and other tracking metrics\n",
    "As mentioned in Part 2, there exists the parameter **track_accuracy_while_fit** that determines whether the approximate accuracy of the model is computed during training or not. The benefit to doing this during training is that you will be able to collect data on how accuracy of the model changes over many iterations. The downside to tracking approximate accuracy during training is that evaluation always slows down the training process (but by a relatively small amount). Approximate accuracy is computed via a 50 iteration moving average of prediction accuracies. At each iteration, if **track_accuracy_while_fit** is true, eLCS will make a prediction of the current instance's class. The correctness of this prediction is factored into the moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to tracking approximate accuracy, scikit-eLCS also tracks a series of other training statistics that may be of use. Aside from average rule population generality (which is tracked at least once an epoch), these following statistics are tracked every iteration:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Average rule population generality (average percentage of rule that is generalized)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Macropopulation size</li>\n",
    "    <li>Micropopulation size</li>\n",
    "    <li>Match set size</li>\n",
    "    <li>Correct set size</li>\n",
    "    <li>Average iteration age of classifiers in correct set</li>\n",
    "    <li>Number of classifiers subsumed in iteration</li>\n",
    "    <li>Number of crossover operations performed in iteration (GA operation)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Number of mutation operations performed in iteration (GA operation)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Number of covering operations performed in iteration</li>\n",
    "    <li>Number of macroclassifiers deleted in iteration</li>\n",
    "    <li>Total training time</li>\n",
    "    <li>Total matching time</li>\n",
    "    <li>Total deletion time</li>\n",
    "    <li>Total subsumption time</li>\n",
    "    <li>Total selection time</li>\n",
    "    <li>Total evaluation time</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics are not time intensive to compute, and thus can be tracked every iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is collecting this kind of iteration by iteration data important? Unlike many other machine learning models, as the eLCS trains, it is easy to visualize its training process, such as how its accuracy or its macropopulation size changes over time. Thus, doing iteration tracking will allow you to export this training progess data (as you will see below) to aid in this visualization. Also, LCSs are stochastic algorithms with no clear stop criteria, so tracking these metrics will allow you to identify when training has stagnated, which can help in future hyperparameter optimization."

    "The final feature to introduce is the ability to \"reboot\" past rule populations. In some cases, you might want to run training, pause training, and resume training at some point in the future. Alternatively, you might want to train the generated rule population on new datasets or with different hyperparameters. The population reboot feature allows you to \"save\" the current rule population into a txt file for future use. You can later initialize a new eLCS estimator with this txt file. When you run fit, the new eLCS estimator will effectively start off where the saved model left off, beginning with the saved rule population, as well as starting at the next sequential learning iteration and adding to the last model's training times. A demo of this is shown below."
