    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a complete user guide to the eLCS scikit-learn package as well as auxilliary helper objects. eLCS is a supervised learning variant of the Learning Classifier System. In general, Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) are a classification of Rule Based Machine Learning Algorithms that have been shown to perform well on problems involving high amounts of heterogeneity and epistasis. Well designed LCSs are also highly human interpretable. LCS variants have been shown to adeptly handle supervised and reinforced, classification and regression, online and offline learning problems, as well as missing or unbalanced data. These characteristics of versatility and interpretability give LCSs a wide range of potential applications, notably those in biomedicine. This package is still under active development and we encourage you to check back on this repository for updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "eLCS, or Educational Learning Classifier System, implements the core components of a Michigan-Style Learning Classifier System (where the system's genetic algorithm operates on a rule level, evolving a population of rules with each their own parameters) in an easy to understand way, while still being highly functional in solving ML problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Learning Classifier Systems are commonly applied to genetic analyses, where epistatis (i.e. feature interactions) is common, the eLCS algorithm implemented in this package can be applied to almost any supervised classification data set and supports:\n",

    "    <li>Multi-class Classification Problems (Multi-class Endpoints)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to mention that the eLCS package does not currently support regression problems (continuous endpoints). Regression functionality is built into the package. However, we have decided to disable it for this version, since eLCS performs best on purely classification problems.\n",

    "### Dataset Format Requirement for eLCS\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 requirements for the dataset:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Data Attributes for all data instances are represented by an <b>nxm</b> numpy.ndarray, where <b>n</b> = # of instances and <b>m</b> = # of attributes for each instance</li>\n",
    "    <li>Data Phenotypes for all data instances are represented by a 1 dimensional numpy.ndarray of length <b>n</b></li>\n",
    "    <li>Both the <b>nxm</b> attribute array and the length <b>n</b> phenotype array are fully numeric. This means that every element in each array must be convertable to a float. String, boolean types are not permitted (of course, boolean datasets can be represented by binary 0s and 1s). It is important to mention that missing data in the attribute dataset is acceptable, if represented as a NaN type within the array. Missing data in the phenotype array is not acceptable.</li>\n",
    "    <li>As mentioned aboved, the problem must be a classification problem. This version does not support regression problems.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The package includes automated parameter checking that will raise an Exception at the start of training if the dataset does not meet the above requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we present 2 methods to load data of the correct format for the eLCS model. The first is the commonly used pandas. The second is a custom, standalone method included with this package named StringEnumerator, that will make your life much easier in terms of ensuring data formatting requirements are met for the eLCS model."

    "**evalWhileFit** is a boolean that determines whether evaluation is done during training or not. The benefit to doing evaluation during training is that you will be able to collect data on how the rule population and general statistics of the model changes over many iterations. The downside to doing evaluation during training is that evaluation always slows down the training process, the amount dependent on how much evaluation is being done.\n",
    "\n",
    "If evalWhileFit is True, then the trackingFrequency and learningCheckpoint parameters become relevant. These two parameters determine two kinds of data tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**trackingFrequency**: Even if evalWhileFit is false, at the end of every iteration, this following information is saved:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Macropopulation size</li>\n",
    "    <li>Micropopulation size</li>\n",
    "    <li>Match set size</li>\n",
    "    <li>Correct set size</li>\n",
    "    <li>Average iteration age (experience) of classifiers in correct set</li>\n",
    "    <li>Number of classifiers subsumed in iteration</li>\n",

    "    <li>Approximate Accuracy</li>\n",
    "    <li>Average Population Generality</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "This distinction is made because approximate accuracy and average population generality are statistics that are time intensive to compute, and thus not included by default in every iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If trackingFrequency == 100 for example, then these two statistics would be collected once every 100 iterations. If trackingFrequency == 0 (the default value), then these two statistics would be collected once every epoch. At the final iteration, full tracking data is collected regardless of trackingFrequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**learningCheckpoints**: learningCheckpoints is a numpy.ndarray that specifies at what iterations a complete training evaluation of the rule population should be completed. Note: iterations are always zero indexed (so the first iteration is enumerated as iteration 0). By default, if evalWhileFit is True, the only learningCheckpoint is the final iteration, where a complete training evaluation is completed on the final rule population. However, evaluations can be done as frequently as specified. An evaluation of the final rule population is done regardless of if was included in learningCheckpoints or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each evaluation, the following data is saved:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> Training Accuracy </li>\n",
    "    <li> Instance Coverage </li>\n",
    "    <li> The complete rule population at the end of that iteration </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the aforementioned data is saved within an IterationRecord object, under the **record** attribute of the scikit eLCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is collecting this kind of iteration by iteration data important? Unlike many other machine learning models, as the eLCS trains, it is easy to visualize its training process, such as how its accuracy or its macropopulation size changes over time. Thus, doing iteration tracking will allow you to export this training progess data (as you will see below) to aid in this visualization. Also, LCSs are stochastic algorithms with no clear stop criteria, so tracking these metrics will allow you to identify when training has stagnated."
